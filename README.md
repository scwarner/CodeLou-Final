# Louisville Mandolin Orchestra Website
## My Code Louisville Front End Web Development Final Project

This website is a redesign of the Louisville Mandolin Orchestra's [website](http://www.lmo.org). While the current site has a lot of good information (maybe *too* much information), it was designed several years ago and does not have any responsive features.

For this project, I added media queries so that the pages would display appropriately on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.

I also added the following interactive features:
* Modal window that opens when a user clicks on the "member" icon in the top right corner of each page
* A search button that displays a search bar when clicked, then informs the user that the feature is not yet functional when they type in a search term and click the search button
* An e-newsletter subscription button on the home page that opens a modal window when clicked
* Buttons on the Concerts page that allow users to filter the information displayed in the Concerts table
* A form on the Contact page that includes checkboxes that display information when clicked

While I have Bootstrap included on the pages for the modal windows, I used CSS flexbox to lay out the pages in attempt to apply the knowledge I gained from my Code Louisville classes. As is apparent, the results are somewhat mixed, especially on Firefox. The site is best viewed in Chrome or IE.
